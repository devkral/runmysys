What's for?

Imagine you could use a computer, plug in a usbdrive or something similar and you have your own system and data.
Everything in a VM. If your system is arm or x86 wouldn't matter anymore.
This is the goal of this project.



Status:

Ready to use for qemu. For other virtualization solutions you have to write the launch code yourself.
Also the autolaunch mechanic isn't ready (not tested) and windows wasn't tested.


INSTALL:
-Copy the python file into /usr/bin (or whatever you like)
-if python file not /usr/bin adjust the paths in the startfiles in the launchmethods directory
install -g root -o root -m 755 ./runmysys.py /usr/bin

Now decide which method you want to use (use just one!)
udev after automount:
-copy 11-runmysys-start-after-automount.rules into /etc/udev/rules.d (or in /usr/lib/udev/rules.d)
install -g root -o root -m 755 ./launchmethods/11-runmysys-start.rules /etc/udev/rules.d
install -g root -o root -m 755 ./launchmethods/runmysysudevhelper.sh /usr/bin
