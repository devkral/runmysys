What's for?

The goal is: you plug in an usb drive or whatever into a pc and have your own working environment and data 



Status:

Ready to use for qemu. Other VMs aren't supported yet.
Also windows wasn't tested (and there is no autolauncher for it).


INSTALL:
-Copy the python file into /usr/bin (or whatever you like)
-if python file not /usr/bin adjust the paths in the startfiles in the launchmethods directory
install -g root -o root -m 755 ./runmysys.py /usr/bin

Now decide which method you want to use (use just one!)
autostart: 
run ./install install
