What's for?

Imagine you could use a computer, plug in a usbdrive or something similar and you have your own system and data.
Everything in a VM. If your system is arm or x86 wouldn't matter anymore.
This is the goal of this project.



Status:

Ready to use for qemu. For other virtualization solutions you have to write the launch code yourself.
Also the autolaunch mechanic isn't ready (not tested) and windows wasn't tested.


INSTALL:
-Copy the python file into /usr/bin (or whatever you like)
-if python file not /usr/bin adjust the paths in the startfiles in the launchmethods directory

Now decide which method you want to use (use just one!)
udev:
-copy 70-lamysys-start.rules into /etc/udev/rules.d (or in /usr/lib/udev/rules.d)
cp ./launchmethods/70-lamysys-start.rules /etc/udev/rules.d
